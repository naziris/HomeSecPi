# HomeSecPi - Home Security System based on Raspberry Pi

The aims of this project are to go through the development process of a home security system and produce a conceptual system, so it can be developed further as a commercial product for the use of the client. The objective of this work is to design and implement a security alarm system that alerts the owner via a SMS and e-Mail if unexpected movement is detected. The system will also feature two different forms of activation/deactivation and a live streaming video will be also available. The advantages of this home security system using alternative open systems, are its high security level, robustness, low cost and ease of use and that there is no distance limitation for contact.

## NOTICE

The source code is not intended to work out of the box. Dependencies need to be installed on your Raspberry Pi, the GPIO pins need to be changed according to your wiring and many other stuff that I can’t really remember since it’s been a long time since the last time I worked on this project. I’m publishing this source code, so I can help others to produce their own system.
This source code has been taken out from a completely working environment, so it’s a working code. What you need to is to reproduce the Raspberry Pi environment and install all the required dependencies which is not easy. If you still want to do it, you need to start reverse engineering the source code. You could start from the launcher.sh ;)

The source code is provided as is! No support will be given regarding issues like the code is not working. As I mentioned earlier the source code is published for referencing purposes only. The easiest way to make it work is to produce your own application and use mine to get inspired.

My thesis report it might be usuful for some of you - http://bit.ly/2z0sR09

## Contribution

If you managed to make it work and you can produce a how to guide for the public, please feel free to contact me so I can update the README file with your instructions.

Also, if you managed to make this project better than what I did (I’m sure you did) and you would like to share it please drop me an email too. I would love to see how you did it. With you approval we might update the source code.
